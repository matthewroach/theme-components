# Headings

Set of components to allow control of headings to maintain their hierarchy
within a page.

Headings (`<h1>` -> `<h6>`) are not to be used to achieve styling goals. They
are to be used to provide semantic meaning and structure to a web page.

Headings should always:
* be used in order
* never skip levels when inceasing in numeric value


## Usage

Using just the `<Heading>` component on its own

```jsx

import { Heading } from '@matthewroach/theme-components';

const BlockFeature = () => (
  <Heading>Heading Text</Heading>
)

```

Using the hierarchy features with `<HeadingSection>`

```jsx

import { Heading, HeadingSection } from '@matthewroach/theme-components';

const SectionBlockFeature = () => (
  <HeadingSection>
    <Heading>Latest Stories</Heading>
    <HeadingSection>
      <Heading>Save the clock tower</Heading>
      <p>...</p>
      <Heading>Mayor voting this Friday</Heading>
      <p>...</p>
    </HeadingSection>
  </HeadingSection>
)

```

### Heading

<Props of={Heading} />

Always use the `<Heading>` component in a block that you wish to make an HTML heading.

The component will use the correct heading element from 1 to 6 depending on location.

By default this will output as `<h1>` if used on its own within a page. To ensure
corrent hierarchy ensure the use of `<HeadingSection>` is used.

### HeadingSection

<Props of={HeadingSection} />

The `<HeadingSection>` component should be used to wrap all `<Heading>` components
that should not be the page title.

The `<HeadingSection>` component will increase the heading element value each time
it is used. If you are making a feature that has a heading to be output as a title
for a group of stories then using the `<HeadingSection>` will increase the
`<Heading>` items for you providing you correct hierarchy output of headings.
